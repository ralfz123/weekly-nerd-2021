# Q: What's a Front-end Developer?
Honestly, I've read a lot about what a FD (Front-end Developer) is. I read about a UI designer, UI developer, Animation developer, "someone that works on the things that users will see". And I know that the term FD is a term dat has been misunderstood en door elkaar gebruikt wordt. Maar wat vind ik dat een FD is?

## The role of user-thinking
In my eyes is a FD a person who inleeft in de gebruiker en denkt en ziet vanuit zijn/haar ogen. Je moet dan ook goed nagaan wat de verlangens en verwachtingen van de gebruiker zijn op de website op dat moment. Daarbij zul je dus ook zeer goed na moeten denken over accesibility, Progressive Enhancement, context of user. These are all things a FD has to deal with. So, a FD is not only a guy or girl with glasses on and is coding till the sun is shining in the morning. No, they have to think about and deal with user-related things.


## But what sort of things has a FD to deal with?
Not only that, also he has to think about, what I've told, _accessibility_. But not only accessibility of users, also of browsers. Browser support is a thing not all FDs has experience with. It's important as FD to think about those things, because as we say it in Dutch "The client is king". The web is accesible for all users, now your website too!

## But, what is at the moment a _good_ Front-end Developer?
A good FD has a bunch of skills he has a lot experience with and expertising with it.

- frameworks
- oopd, reactive
- es 2015+
- optimse performance
